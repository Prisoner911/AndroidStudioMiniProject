# AndroidStudioMiniProject

This is a very novice and beginer level project. We tried making an E Commerce App for Camping Equipment.

THIS PROJECT IS IN JAVA

Requirement to run this project.
XAMPP, Android Studio, and some knowledge of PHP.

Steps to follow to run this project:
1) Install Android Studio.
2) Install XAMPP.
3) Now open XAMPP and start Apache Server and MySQL server.
4) Now open Android Studio and import this project.
5) Make sure to put your ip address at the urls where http request are being called.
6) eg. http://10.0.2.2/path_to_your_api.php. 10.0.2.2 is a local ip for android studio. Something like localhost.
7) Also, there are php api scripts which you have to place in C:/XAMPP/htdocs.
8) Also, you will have to setup Firebase Authentication yourself. You can find many videos on youtube for this.

By the time you import this project, if there are any new updates in Android Studio which might make some functions used in this project obsolete, you will have to search alternatives for them.
Cheers.
