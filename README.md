# AndroidStudioMiniProject

This is a very novice and beginer level project. We tried making an E Commerce App for Camping Equipment.

Requirement to run this project.
XAMPP, Android Studio, and some knowledge of PHP.

Steps to follow to run this project:
1) Install Android Studio.
2) Install XAMPP.
3) Now open XAMPP and start Apache Server and MySQL server.
4) Now open Android Studio and import this project.

By the time you import this project, if there are any new updates in Android Studio which might make some functions used in this project obsolete, you will have to search alternatives for them.
Cheers.
